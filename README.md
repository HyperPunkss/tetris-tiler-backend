## About
Tetris Tiler is our approach to find an innovative way to sell strange tiles so our company doesn't have to throw them away or recycle them back.

We use several approaches to generate and come up with new ideas with the help of Computer Science by implementing the Polyomino Tiling Algorithm. More specifically, we have created a user friendly environment that lets the user choose different tasks that each one returns different tiling outputs. The user through these tasks has the option to control the grid size, the shapes for the grid and their rotations.

Because we want fast results we counted the time our algorithms take to run and we print them as it is a crucial information.
